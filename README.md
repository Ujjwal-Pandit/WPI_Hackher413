## VirtualDress

VirtualDress is a virtual fitting room application that allows users to create a 2D virtual model by uploading a face image and entering personal measurements. The app processes the image using a Python + OpenCV microservice and recommends clothing items based on user input and AI analysis.

### Features

- **User Input:** Height, weight, and face image upload.
- **Automatic Processing:** Calculates BMI, selects a body silhouette, and uses a Python + OpenCV microservice to process the face image.
- **Clothing Recommendations:** Fetches items from MongoDB and optionally uses AI (e.g., Gemini) for outfit suggestions.
- **2D Virtual Fitting:** React frontend overlays clothing images on the base model.
- **Optional Checkout:** "Buy" button to simulate a purchase flow.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v12 or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB** (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)
- **Python** (for the OpenCV microservice)
- *(Optional)* **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd virtualdress
   ```

2. **Install Node Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the Backend**

   Set up your MongoDB connection and other backend configurations as required (refer to the backend documentation).

4. **Set Up the Python Microservice**

   Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed. Follow the microservice-specific instructions (usually provided in a separate README or documentation).

### Usage Overview

- **Input Data:** Users enter their height, weight, and upload a face image.
- **Image Processing:** The Python microservice processes the image to crop the face and overlay it onto a recommended silhouette.
- **Outfit Recommendation:** The backend retrieves clothing recommendations from MongoDB (and may use AI for suggestions).
- **Virtual Fitting:** The React frontend displays the assembled 2D model with recommended outfits.
- **Checkout (Optional):** Users can simulate a purchase flow via the "Buy" button.

### Future Work

- **Enhanced AI Integration:** Improve outfit recommendations with advanced AI.
- **User Customization:** Allow users to adjust body measurements and clothing fits.
- **Payment Integration:** Implement a full checkout process for purchasing items.
